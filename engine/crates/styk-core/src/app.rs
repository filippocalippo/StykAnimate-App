//! The application core's state and its one entry point, [`Core::dispatch`].
//!
//! `Core` owns the open documents (each one's session owns the document, its selection, playhead, history and
//! clipboards), the window's view state, the panels and the derived-facts worker. It routes: a command goes to the
//! module that owns its handler ([`CommandId::info`]), a panel's event to that panel. Every session answer passes the
//! one adapter ([`crate::answers`]), whose record of the dispatch is kept for the consumers of session events.
//!
//! The panels' lifecycle is one, shared ([`Lifecycle`]): before a command runs or another document becomes active,
//! every panel finishes what it has open, as today's `finishCurrentEdit` does; a panel that finds its document no longer
//! active on refresh abandons its open edit on that document. Nothing here blocks or builds geometry (D7): facts that
//! need evaluation come from [`crate::facts`].
